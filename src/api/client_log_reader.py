"""
Live PoE2 game-state reader — tails the client log (Client.txt).

The PoE2 client appends a structured, timestamped event stream to
`logs/Client.txt` while the game runs (verified via ProcMon: ~450 WriteFile
ops per session). This is a LOCAL data source — no API, no network — and the
only way to know the player's *current* character / zone without poe.ninja
(which is broken for patch 0.5 per CLAUDE.md CRITICAL #4).

Data flow:
    Client.txt (118MB+, append-only)
        -> _read_tail()        # seek to EOF, read last N bytes only (never the whole file)
        -> parse_line()        # regex each line into a typed event dict
        -> get_recent_events() # newest-first list of parsed events
        -> get_current_state() # collapse events into {character, level, area, ...}

Line format (after the timestamp/uptime/hash/level prefix):
    2026/06/04 10:51:25 77406656 3ef23347 [INFO Client 29396] : Name (Class) is now level 66
